# Dota2Randomer
Truly random a hero in Dota 2. You get ***none*** of the benefits of randoming that you do with Dota 2's in-built random feature, but even **more** random, random heroes. When you press the random button it will pull Dota 2 to the foreground and after 3 seconds type the hero's name and hover the hero without picking it. This allows you to re-roll if you so desire. As long as Dota 2 is running the button will work. This is meant to be as lightweight and simple as possible.
