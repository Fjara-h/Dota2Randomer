# Dota2Randomer
Truly random a hero in Dota 2. You get ***none*** of the benefits of randoming that you do with Dota 2's in-built random feature, but even **more** random, random heroes. When you press the random button it will pull Dota 2 to the foreground and after 3 seconds type the hero's name and hover the hero without picking it. This allows you to re-roll if you so desire. As long as Dota 2 is running the button will work. This is meant to be as lightweight and simple as possible.

If the time between putting Dota in the foreground is too long or short, for instance, if Dota 2 is in fullscreen mode. After running and quiting the program ince, open the user.config file in %localappdata%/Dota2Randomer edit the WaitTime setting to your preferred milliseconds, the default is 3000.
